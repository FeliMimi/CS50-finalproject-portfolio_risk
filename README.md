# CS50 Final Project - Portfolio Risk Analysis

## Description
This project evaluates the risk of an investment portfolio using Monte Carlo methods. It should calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Var (CVaR) based on historical stock data.

## Technologies
- Python
- panda, Numpy, Matplotlib
- yfinance (for stock data)

## Planned Features
1. Load historical stock data
2. Calculate portfolio returns
3. Run Monte Carlo simulations
4. Compute VaR and CVaR
5. Visualize results
